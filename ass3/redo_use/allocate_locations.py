Prints the names of FMI weather stations separated into four geographical zones in Finland (NW, NE, SW, SE) based on
the coordinates of the stations. Additionally, prints the information about the how equally distributed the station
network is in Finland. 

Description:
    This script is only a test for a planned version that would read in all operative station data 
    from a file and allow users to analyze also analyze weather observations from those stations. 

Note:
    The data only includes stations that were operative 70 years ago (started before 1948).   

Limitations:
    The script will produce and error before step 3 has been solved. 

Usage:
    ./allocate_locations.py
