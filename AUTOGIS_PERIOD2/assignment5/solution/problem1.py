# Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it (8 points)
# 
# Play around with the data that was provided for you and used during the lesson
#  and create as interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map(s) that you can. 
# You can read a few useful hints about what to consider when creating maps from this post.
# 
# Upload your maps to the docs folder and create link to those map(s) in the index.md file. 
# Use your imagination, you can e.g. do some calculations on the current datasets 
# or use also the analyses that we have done earlier in the course.
# 
# But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as 
# best as you can, thus the subject what you are presenting is not important.
